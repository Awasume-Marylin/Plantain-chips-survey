 ### Exploratory Data Analysis

 
1. Which plantain chips type is the most prefered amongst participantsF
 
 ### Findings

 Based on my analysis, i found out that the most prefered plantain chips type is plantain chips type A followed by plantain 
 chips type C with plantain chips type B as the least prefered.

### Recommendation

Based on my analysis findings, i would recommend that;
- The plantain chips company should focus more resources on the production of plantain chips type A and C. The shouldnt completely stop the production of plantain chips type B because it will still have cusumer who like it but just little resources should be put in the production of plnatain chips type B.
